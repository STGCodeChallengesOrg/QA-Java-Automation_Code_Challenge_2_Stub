QA Java Automation Code Challenge #2 (Navigation Menu class):

Write a class that will allow me to navigate the main pages on the site.

Go to https://www.skiutah.com

If you click on Stories, it goes to the Stories page.

Remember to make a VerifyNavigation method that will accept a string value of the menu I want to navigate to and
not something that is static in your code.  This function should work regardless of how many items are in the main
navigation menu and what the labels are for each page.

The sample code stub is found in the WebPageTest.java file.


Refer to the Git Procedure Step By Step document, which contains detailed instructions for accessing code stubs and submitting completed work from/to GitHub.
